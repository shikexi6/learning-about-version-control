# Learning about Version Control
Name: Kexin (Coco) Shi 

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like most about version control is that it saves all the histories of the document and help me keep on track on every versions of the project.

I find most challenging about version control is that we need to navigate between the terminals and the documents, which it is hard for me to find all the ducuments and write all the right comments to some extent.
